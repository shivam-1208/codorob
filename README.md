Codorob â€“ AI Code Assistant
Codorob is a friendly AI-powered chatbot designed to assist developers by generating clean and concise code snippets in Python and C++. It includes a basic Flask backend to handle requests and responses.

Features
Generate clean and optimized code snippets in Python and C++

Friendly and interactive chatbot interface

Supports common programming tasks and algorithms

Helps with debugging and code improvements

Basic Flask backend for API handling

Supported Languages
Python

C++

Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher

pip (Python package installer)

Steps
Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codorob.git
cd codorob
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask backend

export FLASK_APP=app.py      # On Windows: set FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development # Enables debug mode
flask run
The backend will start at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Usage
Send POST requests to the Flask backend API endpoint (e.g., /generate) with the prompt describing the code you want. The backend will respond with the generated code snippet.

Example using curl:

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"language": "python", "prompt": "function to reverse a string"}'
Example Conversation
User: Generate a Python function to reverse a string.  
Codorob:  
def reverse_string(s):  
    return s[::-1]
